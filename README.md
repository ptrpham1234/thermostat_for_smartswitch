# thermostat_for_smartswitch
This is something I designed myself for my heater that isnt automatic. With the help of a Kasa Smart Plug, I'm able to automate the temperature of my room

### Dependencies
The program is a jar file therefore Java JDK is required. Command to install on Debian Distro is here:
```
sudo apt install default-jdk
```

Python itself depends on Kasa and Adafruit DHTs installation for both is here:
```
pip install python-kasa
pip install adafruit-circuitpython-dht
```
